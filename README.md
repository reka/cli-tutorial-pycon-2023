## Preparation

As a preparation for this tutorial, please install:

* [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.1.1/installation.html#install-cookiecutter)
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

We'll start with generating a project with the cookiecutter template [cookiecutter-typer-crud](https://github.com/reka/cookiecutter-typer-crud)

You can adapt the example to use another package manager, but it will be the easiest to follow along with Poetry.
